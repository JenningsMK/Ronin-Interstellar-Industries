# Restructuring within the Corporation

## Office
We should close the following offices unless they have a business critical need
* Vlillirier IV (3,410,543 ISK)
* Ainsan (500,000 ISK)

The reason why I believe we should close the Villierier office is it's outside our area of operation. The reason for Ainsan is the future of the station uncertain.

At a later date when our funds are in a better place we should look at opening an office at The Salty Spitoon (15,000 ISK at time of write up) in Khanid prime and use this as a manufacturing location. 

## Hangers
We should rename the hangers at Hq to the following
1. Donations - Members can put items in here to give to the corp
2. Shared - Members and Corp can share item's that they don't want
3. Boosters - Keep items in here for members with boosting ships to help support them
4. Small Space hanger - A place were we keep beginner fit ships
5. Large Space hanger - A place to keep all the more expensive ships that we can't just give away
6. Item storage - We keep all ship modules, ammo and other items in here that the corp needs.
7. Manufacture & Research - This is where we keep ore from the buy-back and other materials

## Roles & Tiles
At the moment the roles and tiles within the corporation are incomplete with some members having been given the roles **member** and others not. They also open us up to theft.

What I proposal is we remove the **member** and create the following roles
1. Apprentice
2. Trainer
3. Senior trainer
4. Foreman

The name of three first titles are not finalised. Other titles should be created as we need them and one person can have more than one title.

### Associate
This title should allow members to place items within the **donations** hanger and the ability to look inside the **shared** 
hanger. This is to stop a new member from taking everything and running off with it. This does not mean they can't ask 
for items from other members who should be able to give then the request item.   

### Journeyman
This Title should allow members to take from the **shared** hanger as well as place items within **donations** hanger as well. 
It is design for members that we believe we can trust as well as members that have shown willingness to help the corp and other members.

### Kinsman
This title has the same permission as **Trainer** but also allows access to the **small space hanger** to hand out beginner fitted ships to **apprentice**
and the **Item storage** hanger where they can take what they need for person use.

### Foreman
This title are for those members that own ships that are capable of boosting and are willing to use them for corporation business or help other members out.

## Discord and Corporation chat
We should make it easier to send updates and notifications to the corporation separately form the alliance.

### Discord
Each member within discord should have a new role that ties them to the corporation they are in. This will allow sending 
notification a lot easier without the spamming the other corporation within the alliance.

We should also set up category's for each corporation to call their own. This would allow as to create corporation 
announcements and chat channels while not interfering with other corporation within the alliance.
We should still have alliance announcements and chat channels that all members of the alliance has access to.

### Corporation chat
We need to clean up the corporation MOTD and only put information that is required for the corporation, an explain of this would be
