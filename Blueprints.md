# How to use our blueprint library
Those with the title of Scholar have access to our library of blueprints up in our office in Khanid Prime.

In this guide, I will explain how to use our library.

1. Open the **industry** panel.
2. Under "Blueprints" click on the dropdown and select "Owned by corp".
3. Select a blueprint from the list.
4. Make sure "Input Material Location" is set to **Shared**
5. Place the required materials into the **Shared** hanger
6. Set the "Output Location" to **Shared** as well
7. All you have to do is press the "start" button

If you have any questions, please put them in corp chat, so we can try to resolve them quickly
